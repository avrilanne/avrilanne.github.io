     The region was first settled around 1780. The Town of Windham was formed from the Town of Woodstock in 1798 while in Ulster County, New York and before the creation of Greene County. Afterwards, several other towns in Greene County were formed from its territory. These towns include Hunter and Lexington (1813), Prattsville (1833), and part of Ashland in 1848. In 1900, the town's population was 1,240. The major source of income in Windham is the Windham Mountain ski resort, formerly called "Ski Windham". This ski area brings a lot of its skiers up from the New York City area as well as other areas in the northeast. In August 2010 Windham, New York hosted the 2010 World Cup Mountain Bike Race, the first time a World Cup Mountain Bike Race finals occurred on American soil in 20 years of competition. In August 2011, CBS News reported that Hurricane Irene dumped more than 10 inches of rain into the Batavia Kill Creek in just a matter of a couple of hours in a devastating flood.[3] In August 2014 Windham, New York again hosted the World Cup Mountain Bike Race, Windham Mountain being the only US stop of the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup.
