     "The town of Windham, Ulster County, New York, was formed in March of 1798. History books disagree as to whether it was the 23rd or 27th of that month. Windham became the western half of Greene County upon the latterâ€™s creation on March 25, 1800. The seven towns of Ashland, Halcott, Hunter, Jewett, Lexington, Prattsville and Windham were created from what we might call "Old Windham." The towns of New Goshen (Lexington) and Greenland (Hunter) were taken from the southern part of Windham in 1813." ( <a href="http://www.windhamny.com/historicwind.html"> Windhamny.com </a> )
